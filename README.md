# AgeCalculator

That's not about converting data you already have, nor making you laugh. AgeCalculator has the only purpose of showing to yourself how long your unneeded existence have been an actual thing.
At least it has a purpose... do ya?

BE CAREFUL
Not working if ya've travelled at light-speed velocities for a considerable span of time. Hibernation can cause similar unexpected results.
